                <ul>
                    <li>Created first page of website that includes header, email, and button to get to this page. This was using
                        simple HTML.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implemented a "Draw Card" button which selects a random element from a given array.
                        This is to emulate the random draw of a card and was practice for me to learn how to select random
                        items in HTML/JS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created subpage to get to Change log and TODO. This helped me learn how to create different pages in
                        an html website by using links.
                    </li>
                    <li>Created pokemon class to display the different attributes. Had to see how classes are used in JS.</li>
                    <li>Implemented pokemon images to display the pokemon with stats. Learned that I had to use
                        querySelectorAll for multiple images in JS or else only one image will show up.
                    </li>
                    <li>Implemented a feature where your opponent also draws a card to imitate two people playing. Now the draw card
                        button randomly selects two pokemon. Had to keep track of two sets of variables instead of just one in JS.
                    </li>
                    <li>Formatted Home page in grid form using a CSS stylesheet. Had to learn how to create a CSS stylesheet.</li>
                    <li>Created a seperate page for the game and built the game scene using another CSS stylesheet.</li>
                    <li>In the game scene, formatted the pokemon so the stats and names show up in a card-like manner. Used CSS
                        attributes to orient the different elements. I had to learn how to use "class=" ids to orient each element
                        in HTML.
                    </li>
