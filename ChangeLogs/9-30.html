                <ul>
                    <li>This week I focused heavily on creating my game using React. I primarily learned typescript and React.
                        Here's the seperate repository for the game: <a class="underline" href="https://github.com/srinathv31/Pokemon-TB-Game"
                        target="_blank">https://github.com/srinathv31/Pokemon-TB-Game</a>
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Game (React using Components to display visuals)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, I had to move my game from html/css files to a React project. I did this by creating a CSS file for my React project and using bootstrap to recreate
                        the layout I had in my html file.
                    </li>
                    <li>I used Javascript to create a Pokemon class to handle all of the attributes of a Pokemon. However, I had to find a way to translate this into typescript and
                        React. I found that using an explicit class was a little confusing while working in a React app, so I turned my pokemon.js Class into a JSON file.
                    </li>
                    <li>With this JSON file, I created an interface to decribe the Pokemon attributes as if I was using a class in Javascript.</li>
                    <li>One of the biggest things to get used to was breaking down the different aspects of my React app into: components and utilities.</li>
                    <li>I created a data.ts file in my utilities to handle the "Random Draw" function in my React app. Before, I used a Javascript function to randomly select a 
                        Pokemon out of an array and return all of the attributes in html to view it on the page. Now, I used a typescript function to randomly select an ID from my
                        Pokemon.json file which emulates drawing a random pokemon from an array.
                    </li>
                    <li>I then created a Controls.tsx component that uses this typescript function to grab a random Pokemon and set it using useState for both the player and
                        the CPU.
                    </li>
                    <li>I created a PokemonView.tsx component to display the selected Pokemon for each player on the screen.</li>
                    <li>I was running into an issue where the React app didn't properly display the Pokemon images because it could not follow the path. I couldn't find an efficient
                        fix to this but as a temporary solution: I imported the three Pokemon images into the PokemonView.tsx and called a function using switch cases to select the 
                        correct path for the given Pokemon.
                    </li>
                    <li>I created a background for the main battle stage to create a Pokemon game feel using CSS.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Game (React using setState Components)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>After my visual setup was done, I started to work on the logic of the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>At first, I was only trying to implement an attack function which subtracts health from the opponent pokemon given your pokemon's attack attribute. However,
                        I was having a really hard time on figuring this out and it took me 6 days + one day of lab to understand and solve this problem.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was having a difficult time understanding states and how to use setState to update variables throughout my React app.</li>
                    <li>It finally clicked, when I realized I had to lift my "pokemon health" state up into the App.tsx so the entire React app can see when it updates.
                        Essentially, giving it priority. (This may not be correct terminology but I hope this makes sense).
                    </li>
                    <li>Once I understood how setState worked, I then used "health" and "setHealth". I used "setHealth" to initialize the health at the beginning of the
                        game and then used it in my attack function to constantly setHealth everytime the health changes. I then used "health" to display the newly affected health
                        attribute in the battle logger at the bottom and on the Pokemon views.
                    </li>
                    <li>I wanted to make this game similar to a pokemon game and in a pokemon game, there is text that updates you throughout a battle. For example,
                        'Charizard used attack' or 'Squirtle fainted' to keep the player updated in what is happening in a turn-based game.
                    </li>
                    <li>To create this I used a BattleLog.tsx component which has a list of text that activates based on what happens in game. I used the "gameState" useState to
                        update the component on which prompt to display for each action. Throughout the program, I call "setGameState". For example, in Controls.tsx I setGameState
                        to equal the prompt that shows which card the player just drew. Most of my setGameState are handled under BattleControls.tsx.
                    </li>
                    <li>I made BattleControls.tsx component to handle the "attack" and "defend" abilities of the game. I had to use setHealth to update the health while using 
                        the attack button which subtracts the pokemon health from the other pokemon's attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>The "defend" ability is something that I added to create some strategy and flair to the game. When activated, the pokemon has a chance to dodge the opponent
                        pokemon's attack and deliver a critical counter-attack which is the pokemon's attack + 10. I made it so that if a pokemon has a higher defense attribute, the
                        higher chance they have to dodge and deliver a counter-attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>I created a getMissPercent() function in data.ts to generate a random number between the pokemon's defense attribute and 100 (thus a higher defense gives you 
                        a higher chance for a bigger number). Then I pass this number and the pokemon's defense attribute through the getMissValue() function. If the newly generated
                        number is equal to or less than the first number, then the function returns true in BattleControls.tsx and the pokemon successfully dodges the attack. False
                        means the pokemon did not dodge the attack which means the pokemon will take damage minus their defense attribute.
                    </li>
                    <li>I wanted the player to see how much the percent chance was to dodge an attack, instead of having everything behind the scenes. So I had to create a 
                        criticalState in the App.tsx to lift it and set the criticalState to whatever the function calculated it as and pass it through the BattleLog.tsx component
                        to display it at the bottom of the screen.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Game (React: typescript and Game logic)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>In order to make the game feel like you were playing against someone else, I wrote some logic so the CPU also has a chance to counter-attack as if it
                        were a player too.
                    </li>
                    <li>I implemented the same random-percent function to determine whether the CPU would choose to defend or attack. Then, if function returned true, I
                        calculated the dodge/critical-attack chance again to see whether the CPU pokemon can dodge your incoming attack.
                    </li>
                    <li>I felt like this gave the game some unpredictability and some variety between games. Some games the CPU might pull off a comeback by executing 
                        a couple of defends in a row. This gives the player more incentive to choose defend. It also creates risk/reward for both attack and defend buttons.
                    </li>
                    <li>This was all handled under BattleControls.tsx</li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Game (React: rendering components conditionally)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>When starting the game, I wanted the player to be locked into a gameState so they don't accidentally redraw another pokemon or click a button that doesn't
                        relate to the game. This is where I learned how to conditionally render components in React.
                    </li>
                    <li>I created a visible and setVisible useState. I then created a button called "start game" which sets visible to true. If visible is set to true on buttonClick
                        then the "draw card" and "play game" button dissapear and the "attack" and "defense" button appear to start the game.
                    </li>
                    <li>I used this same technique on the "how to play" button to display the directions of the game on the same page. However, I implemented another button called 
                        "close" which sets helpVisible to true which makes the how to play text dissapear and the how-to-play button reappear. This is simply a UI style choice to
                        make it look more like a real product. And to practice using setState to render components.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Game (React: animation)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>I implemented setTimeout() to create an artificial delay to emulate the CPU taking its turn. However, it just looked like the React app was frozen.
                    </li>
                    <li>To solve this problem and display to the user that the CPU is taking its turn, I added a "dot dot dot" CSS animation in the BattleLog to show the player
                        that the moves are being loaded and to give the player enough time to actually read the prompt below.
                    </li>
                    <li>I also included some button and card animations to make the game feel more interactive.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Game (React: What I want to do in the future)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>If I had more time for this project these are things that I would want to do:
                    </li>
                    <li>I want to seperate the dodge and critical attack features so that there is a percent chance calculated for both so it doesn't seem overpowered to 
                        use the defend button all the time.
                    </li>
                    <li>I would create the battle log to become a click through instead of a setTimeout() so that players can read and click through the prompts at their
                        own pace.
                    </li>
                    <li>I tried using a blank Pokemon card template as the background image and fit in all the attributes to that template. However, I was running into
                        formatting issues and the card was very weird looking on certain browsers so I decided to scrap the idea for now and just create a clean look. If
                        I had more time this would be a priority in trying to fix so it simulates a card game more.
                    </li>
                    <li>I want to get more into animations with React maybe using CSS or some other method. Just to add more artistic style to the game.</li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Git (deploying page, git pull issues)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>This week with git I learned how to deploy my React app and create a node.js workflow. This allowed me to simply link the React page to my
                        portfolio page.
                    </li>
                    <li>I had an issue where my local files were not up to date with the git repo. I learned to use -stash to save the local changes and re-push them later
                        after pulling the latest repo.
                    </li>
