                <ul>
                    <li>At first I started writing some logic for this game in JS but I quickly realized that I should be 
                        using React to both fulfill the portfolio rubric and to make development easier on me. However, learning
                        React proved to be a bigger hurdle than I thought it would be so I shifted this week's goal to be mostly
                        frontend aesthetic changes to make the website look more modern and less like something out of 2005.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Home Page (CSS)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>In general, I wanted the entire website to have a consistent theme that looked modern and sleek. I wanted the
                        homepage to only have an intro of my portfolio and links to the game, change-log/TODO, and Source Code pages.
                    </li>
                    <li>The first step I took to have a uniform website theme was creating a CSS stylesheet (index.css) that I will link to every page.
                        This will have my fonts, colors, and classes of how I want each element to look like on my website.
                    </li>
                    <li>I wanted a flat font that was easy to read so I learned how to import Google fonts into a CSS file and used the
                        Lato font for the entire website.
                    </li>
                    <li>I then learned how to create CSS classes to specify how I want each element to look like in my website. For example,
                        specifying how I want all of my headers to look.
                    </li>
                    <li>I wanted the homepage to only have links to the content for my website so I created both links on the homepage itself and
                        a side-menu that includes all of the other pages as well.
                    </li>
                    <li>To create the side-menu that I wanted in my head, I had to learn some CSS animations. For the hamburger icon, I 
                        learned that you can use "transform: " in CSS to rotate elements. I simply created two lines and rotated them in an 
                        X shape when it was active. I then learned about "transition: " which creates this smooth transformation given how
                        much time you want the transformation to take. I combined these two elements to create the hamburger icon animation which
                        turns into an X once active.
                    </li>
                    <li>I figured out that I could have different parts of my website outside of the view of the page. So I essentially have
                        the side-menu at -400px off the screen to the right and when the menu-icon is clicked, the side-menu then slides over 400px
                        to show up on the screen. I also had to set all of the other elements to move to the left 400px to have everything in uniform.
                        Pairing this with the "transition" property, I was able to create a smooth sliding animation for when the menu appears.
                    </li>
                    <li>All of the links still looked static, so I learned how to change the link colors when the mouse hovers over them by 
                        defining a class using "::hover". This allows me to change the color, add animation, etc. everytime the mouse hovers
                        over a link.
                    </li>
                    <li>The biggest challenge for the redesign wasn't the programming but it was finding aesthetic and readable colors to make the 
                        website look good. For example, I knew I wanted a dark theme for my website but I couldn't use straight white because it 
                        strained the eyes when reading text. So I had to use an off-white color. Just finding the colors that matched with each
                        other took some experimenting and research.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Change Log/TODO Page (CSS)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>At first, I was just going to have the Change Log page be static text with the colors of the website theme... Until I found
                        out about CSS animation libraries.
                    </li>
                    <li>I may have overused some animations but I thought I'd spice up the boring Change Log/TODO page.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was doing some googling and found this website <a class="underline" href="https://animate.style" target="_blank">https://animate.style</a> 
                        which had a lot of CSS animations already coded for.
                    </li>
                    <li>I wanted to include the animations from this website to the headers of my change log page to create this "loading"
                        animation just so that it's not static and for me to learn how to do this.
                    </li>
                    <li>At first I included the animations into my css stylesheet as their documenation said I should but nothing was working.
                        I fell into a rabbit hole of trying to debug this for almost two hours. I gave up for a second, but as a last ditch 
                        effort, I changed where I linked the library from my CSS file to the HTML file and it worked somehow! I don't know 
                        why, but I had to link the library in each HTML file that I wanted to use these animations in.
                    </li>
                    <li>I then learned a cross-out effect on my TODO list because I wanted it to behave like an interactive notebook almost.
                        To achieve this animation I had to create a rectangle around the text but made the size to be 1px and set the magins so that
                        the bottom of the rectangle was placed in the middle of the text to create a line. "There might be an easier way to do this 
                        like a library, but I just decided to try to create it on my own."
                    </li>
                    <li>I also had to use Keyframes in this strike-through animation to adjust the speed so it wasn't going too fast to where you can't
                        even see the animation. I am familiar with Keyframes in Adobe and other video-editing software so this didn't take me too long to
                        understand.
                    </li>
                    <li>I wanted the finished items in the TODO list to be crossed out and reveal text when I hovered over it. So I included an
                        animation property on the strike-through line using the cubic-bezier property to have this smooth looking animation of 
                        the line revealing the entire line of text. I used this website <a class="underline" href="https://cubic-bezier.com/#.55,0,.1,.1" target="_blank">https://cubic-bezier.com</a>
                        to experiment with the parameters to see which speed and movement I liked for the animation.
                    </li>
                    <li>I also added some hover properties to the TODO list: 
                        <div class="strike-done">green = finished</div>, <div class="strike-todo">red = still TODO.</div>
                        [To the left, hover over these to see the effect]
                    </li>
                    <li>The Change Log got a bit too big, so I created a list of links that had the change log for each week on its own page.
                        Here I had to learn to use the "text-decoration" property to get rid of the bullet point to the left.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Pokemon Game (CSS, Bootstrap, and React)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>I was able to setup the React project, however it is taking me some time to learn how to use React with things like
                        components so I wasn't able to hit my game logic goals for this week.
                    </li>
                    <li>So I pivoted to making the game look nicer. I used bootstrap to organize the game page into different sections:
                        Header, Player Hand, Battle Stage, CPU Hand, and Footer.
                    </li>
                </ul><br>
                <div><p>Git (branches, new repo)</p></div>
                <ul>
                    <li>I thought that we had to use branches for different aspects of our website so I created a new branch that had
                        my React game code in it. However, Josh told me that I should have a seperate repository just for the game and
                        link that webpage from the portfolio which is what I'm doing now.
                    </li>
                    <li>However, despite branches not really helping me, I learned how to create, destroy, and merge branches. I even used features
                        like checkout and cherry-pick to only merge certain files from a commit between branches.
                    </li>
