        Week of 9/14: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Created first page of website that includes header, email, and button to get to this page. This was using
                simple HTML.
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a "Draw Card" button which selects a random element from a given array.
                This is to emulate the random draw of a card and was practice for me to learn how to select random
                items in HTML/JS.
            </li>
            <li>Created subpage to get to Change log and TODO. This helped me learn how to create different pages in
                an html website by using links.
            </li>
            <li>Created pokemon class to display the different attributes. Had to see how classes are used in JS.</li>
            <li>Implemented pokemon images to display the pokemon with stats. Learned that I had to use
                querySelectorAll for multiple images in JS or else only one image will show up.
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a feature where your opponent also draws a card to imitate two people playing. Now the draw card
                button randomly selects two pokemon. Had to keep track of two sets of variables instead of just one in JS.
            </li>

            <li>Create a seperate page for the game to create a game scene.</li>
            <li>Format the pokemons to be in a card-like form with health bars.</li>
