        Week of 9/14: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Created first page of website that includes header, email, and button to get to this page. This was using
                simple HTML.
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a "Draw Card" button which selects a random element from a given array.
                This is to emulate the random draw of a card and was practice for me to learn how to select random
                items in HTML/JS.
            </li>
            <li>Created subpage to get to Change log and TODO. This helped me learn how to create different pages in
                an html website by using links.
            </li>
            <li>Created pokemon class to display the different attributes. Had to see how classes are used in JS.</li>
            <li>Implemented pokemon images to display the pokemon with stats. Learned that I had to use
                querySelectorAll for multiple images in JS or else only one image will show up.
            </li>
            <li>Implemented a feature where your opponent also draws a card to imitate two people playing. Now the draw card
                button randomly selects two pokemon. Had to keep track of two sets of variables instead of just one in JS.
            </li>
            <li>Formatted Home page in grid form using a CSS stylesheet. Had to learn how to create a CSS stylesheet.</li>
            <li>Created a seperate page for the game and built the game scene using another CSS stylesheet.</li>
            <li>In the game scene, formatted the pokemon so the stats and names show up in a card-like manner. Used CSS
                attributes to orient the different elements. I had to learn how to use "class=" ids to orient each element
                in HTML.
            </li>

            <li><strike>Create a random pokemon card drawer which just equips the card.</strike></li>
            <li><strike>Display the given card with images rather than just text.</strike></li>
            <li><strike>Have pokemon cards posess stats like health, damage, stamina, etc.</strike></li>
            <li><strike>Format the home page so it is simple with two links. One to Change log and one to the game.</strike></li>
            <li><strike>Create a seperate page for the game to create a game scene.</strike></li>
            <li><strike>Format the pokemons to be in a card-like form</strike> with health bars.</li>

        Week of 9/20: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>Include status bars which correspond to each stat like health,etc. under the pokemon.</li>
            <li>Start creating the game logic (turn-based) along with text updates at the footer of 
                the in-game events. Ex: "Charizard used attack"
            <ol>
                Note: I feel like there is a lot that will go into this objective. I will update this list
                as I figure out what exactly this entails.
            </ol></li">
            <li>Implement dynamic health bar in the Battle Stage. So you can see in real time how
                low your pokemon's health is.
